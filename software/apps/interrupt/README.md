Interrupt Application
=====================

This is part of Lab1 - MMIO and Interrupts.

_Warning:_ this lab cannot be used in final projects as-is. Instead use SDK libraries to interact with devices and interrupts.

Use buttons on the Microbit to trigger an interrupt handler.
Also trigger software interrupts and demonstrate nested interrupt
priorities.
