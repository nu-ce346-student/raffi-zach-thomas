GPIO Application
================

This is part of Lab1 - MMIO and Interrupts.

_Warning:_ this lab cannot be used in final projects as-is. Instead you should
use the SDK GPIO library.

Implement a GPIO library using Memory-Mapped IO. Using
that library control the Microphone LED with the buttons
on the Microbit.
